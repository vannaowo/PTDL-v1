# PTDL-v1

A short README for the PTDL-v1 repository. This repository currently contains a PDF (PTDL-BTL.pdf) that appears to be the main project deliverable.

## Contents

- `PTDL-BTL.pdf` — Primary project document (report, design, or thesis). Open this file to read the full material.

## About

This repository holds the PTDL-BTL.pdf file (previewed at the repository root). The PDF appears to be the main output for this project. Use this repository to store the final report and any supporting files, source code, or additional resources that go with the project.

If this repo should include source code or other assets alongside the PDF, consider adding subfolders:
- `src/` — Source code and scripts
- `docs/` — Additional documentation and notes
- `data/` — Sample datasets or resources used by the project
- `assets/` — Images, diagrams, or large binary files

## How to view

To view the PDF:
- Click the file in the repository on GitHub to view it in the web viewer.
- Or download the file and open it with any PDF reader (Adobe Reader, Preview, SumatraPDF, etc.)

## Suggested next steps

- Add a short project description or abstract to this README summarizing what the PDF contains (e.g., project goals, results, authors).
- If there is source code or build steps related to the PDF, add a `Getting Started` or `Usage` section describing how to run or reproduce the work.
- Add a LICENSE file to clarify reuse permissions (e.g., MIT, CC-BY, etc.).
- Add a CONTRIBUTORS or AUTHORS section with your name and contact details.

## Contact

If you’d like me to commit this README to the repository or open a pull request, tell me:
- The branch name to use (or let me create one),
- The repository and owner (I inferred `vannaowo/PTDL-v1`),
- Whether you want a specific license added or any additional content (author name, summary/abstract).

I can create the file and open a PR for you when you confirm.
